For my third project i will be updating my grilling app. I will beceating a new menu for easy navigation form anywhere within the app.
I will also create a video page that will have videos pulled from a youtube channel. I will also have an updated recipies page
that will feature many different recipies. I will also be including a copy of the E-Cook book that was given to me with a link to 
the webpage where the actual cook book can be purchased. While this app will mainly be displaying text and pictures I will be updating the 
design of it and improving on the functionality abd content of this app. I am also looking into having a tab where you can plug in a meat thermometer
into your smart phone and then you will be able to get the tempurature of the meat displayed on the phone.
