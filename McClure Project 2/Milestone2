For my app I am doing a Grilling guide. The user will start on the some screen and select the item that they are wanting to grill. 
The page will open up and information will be provided on the correct temp to set the grll to and how long to cook based on size. 
It will also provide some marination and seasoning tips as well as various ways to grill the particulat item. The user can navigate 
through the options using the buttons on the bottom of each page, or they can return to the home screen each time to select a differnet
item.
